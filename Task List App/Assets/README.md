### 📝 v1.0.0.4 - February 2024

* Fixed backup day count.
* Added [MessageDialog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.popups.messagedialog?view=winrt-22621) overdue summary.
    - Added new config `ShowOverdueSummary` to SettingsViewModel.
* Added new feature: `Notes`

### 📝 v1.0.0.3 - August 2023

* I have reworked this entire project, which was originally from [Pdawg-bytes](https://github.com/Pdawg-bytes/WinUI3-TaskList)
* It is now fully functional and bug-free. I have left **TODO** markers for a developer's future enhancements.
* I have removed the code related to [WinUIEx](https://github.com/dotMorten/WinUIEx) as it was causing conflicts/exceptions and preventing the update of the existing SDKs.
    - Where relevant, I added code to handle the resizing, icon update and centering of the *MainWindow*.
* This project uses the following additional packages:
    - [CommunityToolkit.WinUI](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit)
    - [CommunityToolkit.Common](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/communitytoolkit.common?view=win-comm-toolkit-dotnet-7.0&viewFallbackFrom=win-comm-toolkit-dotnet-6.1)
    - [CommunityToolkit.Mvvm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/)
    - [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting)
    - [Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.WinUI.Managed](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.WinUI.Managed)
    - [MicroCharts](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microcharts) and [SkiaSharp.Views.WinUI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp.Views.WinUI)

## 🚀 Future Enhancments
* Application activation via **Toast Notifications** still needs work.
  - This can be handled through `Task_List_App.Services.ActivationService.HandleActivationAsync`.
  - I have added the logic, but a [Mutex](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.mutex?view=net-6.0) will need to be created and managed.
* Language conversions and additional `x:Uid` tags.

## 🎛️ Usage
* You can run this as a normal desktop app. Tooltips are provided for each action.
* I recommend compiling/running as an `Unpackaged` application.
* If the database is absent, a new one will be created.
* `Alt-A` Adds a new task.
* `Alt-S` Saves any changes.
* `Alt-X` Exit the application.
* If the task's title contains a URL then it will be opened in a browser when that task is selected in the list.
* After adding the **Complete** `AppBarButton` (which was ment to mark multiple tasks when ready), I found it was easier to use the `CheckBox`. I have left this `AppBarButton` for posterity.
